                TIPS~
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Never stretch your pie crust within the pan, stretching it will cause the crust to shrink during
                    baking.</li>
                <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <li>If using a prepared pie crust that has been refrigerated, take it out of the refrigerator at
                        least 15
                        minutes before trying to unroll it, this will greatly reduce the risk of getting cracks that
                        need to be
                        repaired. If you DO happen to tear or crack the dough while forming it into the pie pan,
                        slightly dampen
                        your fingers and gently push and pinch the dough to close up any holes.</li>

            I'm not really much of a cook or baker - I just don't enjoy it and only cook enough to keep my family alive!
            However, there are a few items that are
            looked for by other family members when we get together for special occasions if they know I will be
            present. One of those items is deviled eggs. I have never shared my recipe for those and I'm not about to
            start! The recipe that I will share, and is also something my family counts on; is Pecan Pie. It is a simple
            recipe, made more simple with the use of pre-made pie crust. Although I used to make my own pie crust dough,
            for awhile I lacked the space to easily roll out the dough - now I'm just too spoiled and use store-bought!
            <br><br>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Single 9" Pie Crust - (I usually buy the Pillsbury brand)</li>
            <li>3 Eggs - slightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 Cup Dark Corn Syrup</li>
            <li>&#8532 Cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>&#8531 Cup Butter or Margarine - melted</li>
            <li>1 Cup Raw Pecan Halves</li>
            <li>Salt - dash</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350&deg;</li>
            <br>
            <li>Form pastry crust into a 9" pie pan. If using a premade crust, it will probably be too large. Make sure
                to approximately center it into the pan. Working from the center out, <em>GENTLY</em> smooth the
                bottom out. When
                you are getting toward the inner corner, lift the outer edge of the dough while at the same time easing
                the dough to conform to the corners. Gently press the dough up the sides of the pan and let the dough
                drape over the edges. There are many ways to finish off the edge, I like to fold the edges inwards and
                then pinch with my fingers to form a decorative edge. You can also use a fork but I like my edge to rise
                above the pan edge to lessen the chance of the filling bubbling over during baking. Cover edge of crust
                with thin strips of baking foil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the slightly beaten eggs, sugar, and dash of salt until grains are dissolved. Add
                the corn syrup and melted butter and mix well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Stir in the pecan halves. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Place the prepared pan on a baking sheet, then pour your mixture into the prepared pastry crust. Slide
                onto middle rack of oven and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
            <br>
            <li>After 25 minutes, carefully remove the foil from the pie crust edges and bake for an additional 25-30
                minutes or until a knife inserted OFF-center comes out clean. Filling will continue to solidify for
                a bit after it is out of the oven. This is the tricky part about pecan pies, if it isn't baked long
                enough it will be somewhat soupy, but if baked too long the pie, and most defintely the crust edges,
                will burn. </li>
            <br>
            <li>Cool on a wire rack and then cover and refrigerate. </li>
        </ol>
